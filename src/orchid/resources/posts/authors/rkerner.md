Hey! My name is RenÃ© Kerner and I am a software engineer, software architect
and public speaker from Germany. I am currently living close to DÃ¼sseldorf in MÃ¶nchengladbach.

For many years I am working on different projects around [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)&reg;
and since mid 2020 I am working for Red Hat on the [Debezium](https://debezium.io/) project,
a platform for change data capture.
                                      
Before I was working for METRO Markets, a startup from METRO AG an international
wholesale company which in 2010 was the fourth-largest retailer in the world
measured by revenues, after Wal-Mart, Carrefour and Tesco, building their digital
marketplace.

From mid 2018 to mid 2019 I was working for [codecentric AG](https://www.codecentric.de)
as senior IT consultant for software architecture, mainly focused on Apache Kafka,
distributed systems (including microservices), datastores, and software engineering
with main focus on Java, Kotlin and PHP in the web. I helped customers with their
software-architectural and digital transformation.

Before that I was known as [trivago](https://tech.trivago.com/)'s very own architecture
rebel working as software architect and engineer in the DÃ¼sseldorf headquarter
for 6,5 years. It was an amazing time to see a startup with around 100 people on
one floor in one building (when I joined) growing to over 1500 people in 4
development locations across Europe.

I am speaker at user groups and IT conferences and local organizer of the
[DÃ¼sseldorf Apache Kafka&reg; Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Dusseldorf-Kafka-Meetup/)
and contributor to open source projects (Debezium, ANTLRv4, ComposerPHP, Symfony2).

I care about delivering modern software solutions that fit customer's requirements and
add great value, high-scale environments, an agile culture of respect, focus,
entrepreneurial thinking and authenticity, distributed systems,
data streaming with Apache Kafka and Debezium, datastores,
software development with Java, Kotlin and PHP, DevOps and Ops, operating systems,
configuration management, CI/CD and automation, virtualization, containers & cloud.  
I strive for excellence in what I do, and for improving my skills and knowledge
all the time.

In my spare time I like watching TV series ðŸŽ¥, traveling ðŸ›«, diving ðŸ¤¿, archery ðŸŽ¯
and generally being outside in nature for photography ðŸ“¸, biking ðŸš´ or hiking, and I love
visiting theme parks ðŸŽ¢.
